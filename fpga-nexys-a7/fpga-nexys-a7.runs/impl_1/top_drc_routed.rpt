PDRC-153#1 Warning
Gated clock check  
Net soc/spi_top_module/spi_regs_module/reg_sck_mode_ff_reg[1]_0 is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin soc/spi_top_module/spi_regs_module/spi_clk_reg_LDC_i_1/O, cell soc/spi_top_module/spi_regs_module/spi_clk_reg_LDC_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
